## Introduction

First Responders line of work places them at a heightened risk of psychological distress, which can impact their overall well-being and ability to continue their service [@Obuobi]. Notably, studies examining first responders who served during the 9/11 attacks reveal lower PTSD prevalence than other populations in the first 3 years following 9/11, but show substantial increase in prevalence after that point [@Lowell].

Given the susceptibility of first responders to developing PTSD, it becomes imperative to investigate the factors that elevate this risk. This study seeks to address this by employing Tree-based methods, which provide an intuitive approach to observe risk factors. These methods are able to capture non-linear effects and interactions, without a priori specification [@Banerjee]. In light of these advantages this algorithm can be instrumental in offering preventive measures, ensuring that first responders with particular risk factor combinations receive mental health services when needed most.

Hence, the primary aim of this study is to construct a tool that empowers frontline mental health professionals to construct a well-organized interactive risk map. This map will enable the vigilant monitoring of first responders who may be at risk of developing PTSD, providing an invaluable resource for the provision of timely and tailored mental health services.


## Methods

Mental health data was obtained through structured interviews conducted during their second visit to the World Trade Center Health Program, where a clinician established a PTSD diagnosis. This diagnosis serves as the primary outcome variable in this study. The predictors were carefully selected based on a review of relevant literature and derived from these interviews. These variables encompass aspects such as trauma exposure, hazardous material exposure, prior traumatic experiences, physical health, emotional distress, and demographics. This comprehensive dataset comprises 32 predictors in addition to the PTSD diagnosis. The dataset was partitioned into 70% for training and 30% for testing, utilizing stratification to ensure a representative split. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, fine-tuning the model for optimal performance.

## Results

The study sample consisted of 1,107 9/11 first responders who have relocated to the state of Florida, with a predominant representation of males (87%), and the average age at the time of the 9/11 attacks was 39.7 years.  Table 1 displays the demographic characteristics stratified by the presence or absence of a PTSD diagnosis.

```{r, demographics, out.width="80%"}
analysis_df <- 
  readRDS(here::here("tree","analysis_df.rds"))

analysis_df |>
  rename("Age at 911" = Age911, 
         "PCL Score" = PCL) |> 
  tbl_summary(
    include = c("PCL Score", "Age at 911", Sex,  Race, Hispanic,  Education), 
    statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})"), 
    digits = list("PCL Score" ~ 1, 
                  "Age at 911" ~ 1),  
    by = ptsd_symptoms, 
    missing = "no") |> 
  bold_labels() |> 
  # modify_spanning_header(c("stat_1", "stat_2") ~ "**Current PTSD**") |> 
  modify_header(label ~ "") |> 
  modify_caption("First Responders 9/11 by PTSD Diagnosis") |> 
  add_overall( last = TRUE) |> 
  add_p() |> 
  as_gt() |> 
  tab_options(table.font.size = 30)
```

In the assessment of the algorithm's performance on the training dataset, we observe a strong AUC value of 0.84, as depicted in Figure 2.

```{r roc, echo=FALSE,collapse=TRUE, out.width="80%"}
tree_pred <- readRDS(here::here ("outputs", "tree_pred.rds"))

tree_pred |> 
  roc_curve(truth = ptsd_symptoms, 
           .pred_Yes, 
           event_level = "second") |> 
  autoplot() 
```


Table 2 presents the accuracy rate, sensitivity and specificity percentages surpassing the 70% mark. These findings collectively highlight the algorithm's proficiency in classifying cases, particularly with a focus on sensitivity

However, when these same metrics are evaluated on the testing set, all metrics drop to levels around the 60s%, indicating that the algorithm's performance is only marginally better than random classification. These findings strongly suggest that the algorithm is overly tailored to the specific characteristics of the training dataset, implying overfitting. Consequently, it should not be considered a reliable and generalizable tool for first responders dealing with mass casualty events.

```{r metrics, fig.align='center'}
metrics_table <- 
  readRDS(here::here("outputs", "metrics_table.rds")) |> 
  mutate(Dataset = "Training")
metrics_test <- 
  readRDS(here::here("outputs", "metrics_result_test.rds")) |> 
  mutate(Dataset = "Testing") |> 
  rename(Metric = .metric, 
         Estimate = .estimate) |> 
  select(-c(.estimator, .config))
  

metrics_total_table <- 
  bind_rows(metrics_table, metrics_test) |> 
  mutate(Metric = str_to_title(Metric)) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Metric", values_from = "Estimate") |> 
  rename(AUC = Roc_auc)

gt::gt(metrics_total_table) |> 
   tab_options(
    table.font.size = 30,
    footnotes.font.size = 5
  ) |> 
  # gt::tab_header(
  #   title = "Performance Metrics for the Classification Tree",
  #   subtitle = "Predicting PTSD Diagnosis Among a Subset of 9/11 First Responders"
  # ) |> 
  fmt_number(
    columns = c(Sensitivity, Specificity, Accuracy, AUC),
    decimals = 2,
    use_seps = FALSE
  ) |> 
  tab_source_note(
    source_note = "AUC: Area Under the Curve")
```

## Discussion 

This study aimed to find the primary risk factors and their interaction in predicting a PTSD diagnosis within a cohort of 9/11 first responders who had relocated to Florida, using tree-based methods. The results of this study highlight several key risk factors that contribute to the likelihood of a PTSD diagnosis within this sample. 

These risk factors identified in this analysis align with previous research, reinforcing the significance of exposure intensity and 9/11-related injury as primary contributors to PTSD risk, as noted in prior studies [@Lowell]. Literature reviews conducted in the decade following the event also consistently emphasized the influence of higher initial emotional responses and older age on PTSD risk [@neria]. This research contributes by not only confirming these findings but also by revealing how they interact with other factors.

In this regard, Classification Trees stand out as powerful statistical learning methods for efficiently identifying valuable predictors of an outcome and uncovering interactions among these predictors. The use of trees in this study provides a predictive model that can aid clinical decision-making in diagnosing PTSD among first responders.

However, it's essential to acknowledge the limitations of this study. The non-random sample and the cross-sectional nature of the data may restrict the generalizability of the findings, as this sample specifically comprises first responders relocated to Florida. A thorough analysis comparing this sample to the broader population of 9/11 first responders is lacking. Additionally, overfitting is a concern given the unique characteristics of this population and the chosen technique. Future research should consider employing methods like Random Forest or Boosted Trees to reduce overfitting and enhance the model's generalizability and predictive accuracy.
